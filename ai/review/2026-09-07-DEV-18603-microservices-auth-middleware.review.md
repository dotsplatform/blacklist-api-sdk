# DEV-18603 — send the internal gateway token (blacklist-api-sdk)

Branch: `feature-DEV-18603`

## What changed

The SDK now sends `X-Internal-Gateway-Token` on every request, so its consumers
keep working once the `blacklist` service starts requiring it.

- `src/App/HttpClient.php` — header constant + the token is read once and put into the client headers
- `src/config/blacklist-api-sdk.php` — new `token` key, read from `BLACKLIST_INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN`

The header constant is declared as an untyped `private const` to stay compatible
with the PHP versions this package still supports.

## Env variable

`BLACKLIST_INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN` — the same value the `blacklist` service is configured with.

## Release

This package must be tagged (minor bump) and the new version pulled into its
consumers: `livesite`, `sms`, `verification`. The existing caret constraints already accept a minor
bump, so only `composer.lock` changes there.

## Database / performance

No database access, no queries, no schema changes.

## Risk

If a consumer is deployed with an old SDK version after the service is closed,
its calls return 401. Release the SDK and update consumers **before** the
service is deployed.

## v2: shared token (2026-09-25)

The per-service secrets (`<SERVICE>_INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) are replaced by one
secret shared by all Dots services: **`INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN`**.

- Only the `env()` name behind the existing config keys changed. Middleware,
  header (`X-Internal-Gateway-Token`), fail-closed behaviour and route coverage
  are exactly as described above.
- `.env.example` lists `INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN=` once.
- `SEARCH_INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN` / `CATALOG_INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN` are not
  touched — `search` and `catalog` keep their own secrets.
- Database changes / migrations: none. Performance risks: none (config only).
- ⚠️ Rollout: `INTERNAL_GATEWAY_TOKEN` must be set to the same value in every
  project and every environment before deploy; the old per-service variables
  are no longer read and can be removed afterwards. SDK consumers pick up the
  new name only after the SDK tag is released and `composer.lock` is updated
  (their published config copies are already switched).
